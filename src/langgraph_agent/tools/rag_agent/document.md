### **COMPREHENSIVE HOMEOWNERS POLICY**

The policy consists of these wordings, the Certificate of Property Insurance which contains information that is unique to your insurance policy and other forms that may need to be attached to complete your package coverage. Together, these represent the legal contract of indemnity that exists between you and us. This policy contains various exclusions which eliminate or restrict coverage. Please read it carefully.

#### **INSURING AGREEMENT**

We provide the insurance described in this policy in return for payment of the premium and subject to the terms and conditions set out.

All amounts of insurance, premiums and other amounts as expressed in this policy are in Canadian currency.

The Certificate of Property Insurance summarizes the Insurance coverage you have selected and the premiums, limits, amounts and deductibles that apply to them. Among other things, the Certificate of Property Insurance also identifies the policyholder, the policy term and any Endorsements that apply to your Insurance Coverage.

Only losses that occur within the policy term shown on the Certificate of Property Insurance will be covered under this policy. There will be no coverage for any loss that occurred or was in progress prior to the policy period inception date or after the policy period expiry date shown on the Certificate of Property Insurance.

Insurance cannot be a source of profit. It is only designed to indemnify you against actual losses incurred by you or for which you are liable.

If during the term of this policy we change the insurance of the kind provided by this policy to provide more coverage at no additional cost, you will automatically benefit from that change at no increase in premium.

This form consists of three Sections:

**SECTION I** describes the insurance on your property. It also includes additional living expenses and/or fair rental value in certain circumstances.

**SECTION II** describes the insurance for your legal liability for bodily injury to others or damage to property of others arising out of your premises or your personal actions. It also includes benefits following injury and damage to property of others in certain other circumstances.

### **BASIS OF CLAIM PAYMENT**

We will pay for insured loss of or damage to the dwelling and detached private structures and personal property as described below up to your financial interest in the property, but not exceeding the applicable amount(s) of insurance for any loss or damage arising out of any one occurrence.

### **Amounts Not Reduced**

Any payments made for loss or damage will not reduce the amounts of insurance provided by this policy.

### **Actual Cash Value**

The Actual Cash Value will take into account such things as the cost of replacement less any depreciation, and in determining depreciation we will consider the condition immediately before the damage, the resale value and the normal life expectancy.

### **Deductible**

We are responsible only for the amount by which the loss or damage covered by this policy of insurance exceeds the amount of the deductible shown on the Certificate of Property Insurance in any one occurrence. If your claim exceeds

\$25,000, and the applicable deductible amount on the Certificate of Property Insurance is \$1,000 or less, the deductible will not apply to your claim.

If your claim involves personal property on which the Special Limits of Insurance apply, the limitations apply to losses exceeding the deductible amount.

### **Dwelling and Detached Private Structures**

If you repair or replace the damaged or destroyed building on the same location with a building of the same occupancy constructed with materials of similar quality within a reasonable time after the damage we will pay the cost of repairs or replacement (whichever is less) without deduction for depreciation.

If you do not repair or replace we will pay the actual cash value of the damage on the date of occurrence.

## **Guaranteed Replacement Cost on Dwelling Buildings**

If Guaranteed Replacement cost is indicated in the Certificate of Property Insurance, we will pay the cost of repairs or replacement even if it is more than the amount of insurance for Coverage A, provided:

- 1. the amount of insurance for Coverage A shown on the Certificate of Property Insurance:
  - a. on the inception date of the policy; or
  - b. the most recent renewal date; or
  - c. the increased amount under the inflation protection coverage on the date the increase took effect was not less than 100% of the cost to replace the dwelling building, as determined by a valuation guide acceptable to us;
- 2. the amount of insurance applicable to Coverage A has not been reduced below the amount determined by the valuation guide; and
- 3. you notified us within 30 days of the start of the work if any improvement, extension or addition has been made to your dwelling where the value of such improvement, extension or addition exceeds \$10,000.
- 4. you repair or replace the damaged or destroyed building on the same location with a building of the same occupancy constructed with materials of similar quality within a reasonable time after the damage.

In determining the cost of repairs or replacement we will not pay or include the increased costs of repair or replacement due to the operation of any law regulating the zoning, demolition, repair or construction of buildings and their related services.

# **Insurance Under More Than One Policy**

If you have insurance on specifically described property, this policy will be considered excess insurance and we will not pay any loss or claim until the amount of such other insurance is used up.

In all other cases, we will pay our ratable proportion of the loss or claim under this policy.

### **Personal Property**

- 1. For electronic media we will pay the cost of reproduction from duplicates or from originals of the previous generation of the media. We will not pay the cost of gathering or assembling information or data for reproduction.
- 2. For other records, including books of account, drawings or card index systems, we will pay the cost of blank books, pages, cards or other materials plus the cost of actually transcribing or copying the records.
- 3. We will pay on the basis of replacement cost for all other personal property except:
  - a. articles that cannot be replaced with new articles because of their inherent nature, including antiques, fine arts, paintings and statuary;
  - b. articles for which their age or history substantially contributes to their value, such as memorabilia, souvenirs, and collectors items;
  - c. property that has not been maintained in good or workable condition;
  - d. property that is no longer used for its original purpose;
  - for which we will pay only on the basis of actual cash value.

Replacement cost means the cost, on the date of the loss or damage, of the lower of:

- 1. repairing the property with materials of similar kind and quality; or
- 2. new articles of similar kind, quality and usefulness;

without any deduction for depreciation.

We will pay on the basis of replacement cost only if the property lost or damaged is repaired or replaced as soon as reasonably possible. Otherwise we will pay on the basis of actual cash value.

You may choose payment on the basis of actual cash value initially. If you later decide to replace any destroyed or stolen property you may make an additional

{6}------------------------------------------------

claim for the difference between the actual cash value and replacement cost basis within 180 days after the date of loss.

For personal property described under "special limits of insurance" we will not pay more than the applicable limit under either the replacement cost or actual cash value basis.

# **Single Limit of Insurance**

### If:

- 1. a single event or occurrence results in loss or damage which is insured under more than one of Coverages A, B, C and D, and
- 2. Single Amount of Insurance appears on the Certificate of Property Insurance, and
- 3. the Guaranteed Replacement Cost on Dwelling Buildings provision does not apply,

the amount of insurance available to cover such insured loss or damage will be the total of the individual amounts for Coverages A, B, C and D.

If the Guaranteed Replacement Cost on Dwelling Buildings provision applies to your claim under Coverage A, the maximum amount of insurance available for insured loss or damage under Coverages B, C and D will be the total of the individual amounts for those Coverages.

# **CONDITIONS**

The following conditions apply to the coverage provided by Section I of this policy.

# **Pair and Set**

In the case of loss or damage to any article(s) which is (are) part of a set the measure of loss of or damage to such article(s) will be a reasonable and fair proportion of the total value of the set, but in no event will such loss or damage be construed to mean total loss of the set.

# **Parts**

In the case of loss or damage to any part of the insured property consisting, when complete for use, of several parts, we will not pay for more than the insured value of the part lost or damaged, including the cost of installation.

# **Permissions Granted**

You have our permission under the terms and conditions of this policy to:

- 1. make alterations, additions and repairs to the dwelling building that you occupy. (You may, however, need to request an increase in your Limits of Insurance.)

- 2. store and use reasonable and normal quantities of fuel oil, gasoline, benzene, naphtha or other similar materials.

# **Statutory Conditions**

All of the conditions set out under the title Statutory Conditions apply with respect to all of the perils insured under Section I except that these conditions may be modified or supplemented by the provisions of the said Section I or by forms or endorsements which modify Section 1.

# **Subrogation**

We will be entitled to assume all your rights of recovery against others and bring action in your name to enforce these rights when we make payment or assume liability under this policy. Your right to recover from us is not affected by any release from liability entered into by you prior to loss.

If such action on our part does not fully indemnify both you and us, the amount that we recover will be divided between you and us in the proportions in which the loss or damage has been borne by each of us respectively. The amounts so available for distribution shall be net of the costs of effecting the recovery.
